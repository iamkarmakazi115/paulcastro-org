                                <p>Kael is the last descendant of the Progenitor, the first werewolf, and his blood is the key to an ancient relic that could either save the world or destroy it. Thrust into a war between supernatural races, he must forge unlikely alliances with exiled Fae warriors, battle-scarred trolls, storm-wielding djinn, and vengeful banshees‚Äîall while learning to master the beast within.</p>

                                <p>Christos Thanatos has spent twenty-six years hiding in plain sight‚Äîworking security jobs, living in a Chicago high-rise, and pretending the voices of the dead are just background noise. The son of Hades should be ruling the underworld, but he's chosen the mortal world instead, finding peace in the arms of Elena Martinez, an art history student who sees past his supernatural nature.</p>

                                <p>The ransom isn't money‚Äîit's blood. Five divine bloodlines must die to fuel an ancient ritual that will birth a god without conscience, without love, without the weaknesses that make divinity worth worshipping. Each kill brings Christos closer to saving the woman he loves, but further from the man he wants to be.</p>
                                
                                <p>As Chicago burns with divine fire and Titans descend from storm-torn skies, Christos discovers his father's true plan: not just to create the perfect god, but to tear down the masquerade that has kept supernatural and human worlds separate for centuries.</p>
